      Milan Cathedral, called Duomo di Milano in Italian, is a vast Gothic-style cathedral, located in the heart of Milan. It is 515 ft (157 metres) long and 302 ft (92 m) wide. It can house up to 40.000 people. Il Duomo di Milano is one of the largest Catholic churches in the world.

      <p>  The Cathedral took five centuries to complete. During this time, various architects, sculptors and artists contributed to the famous construction program known as the “Fabbrica del Duomo”. The result was an impressive and unique piece of architecture, which merged the international Gothic style with the Lombard Romanesque style.
